### Task 4: Configure a static website to access the blob container

In this task, you will learn how to use the Azure portal to configure a static website to access the blob container.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

An Azure account, a storage account (Complete Task 1), an azure blob container (Complete Task 1 & Task 2). To configure a static website to access the blob container, follow these steps:

#### Steps

1. Launch Visual Studio Code by double click on Vscode icon from desktop.

2. On the toolbar, click Extensions. Search for Azure Storage, and select the Azure Storage extension from the list. Then click the Install button to install the extension.

![image](../media/str15.png)

3. Open the Azure portal in your web browser.

4. Locate your storage account and display the account overview.

![image](../media/str8.png)

5. Select **Static website** to display the configuration page for static websites under **data management** section.

6. Select Enabled to enable static website hosting for the storage account.

7. In the Index document name field, specify a default index page of index.html. The default index page is displayed when a user navigates to the root of your static website.

8. In the Error document path field, specify a default error page of 404.html. The default error page is displayed when a user attempts to navigate to a page that does not exist in your static website. Click Save.

![image](../media/str16.png)

9. The Azure portal now displays your static website endpoints (primary and secondary). Azure Storage automatically creates a container named $web. The $web container will contain the files for your static website.

![image](../media/str17.png)

Next, create a Hello World web page with Visual Studio Code and deploy it to the static website hosted in your Azure Storage account.

10. Create an empty folder named mywebsite on your local file system.

11. Launch Visual Studio Code, and open the folder that you just created from the Explorer panel, by selecting open folder option.

![image](../media/str18.png)

12. Select Yes, I trust the authors Trust folder and enable all features.

![image](../media/str19.png)

13. Create the default index file in the mywebsite folder, by selecting Add file option and provide the name index.html in the name box.

![image](../media/str20.png)

14. Open index.html in the editor, paste the following html script into the file, and save it:

    ```<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

![image](../media/str21.png)

15. Create the default error file and name it 404.html.

16. Open 404.html in the editor, paste the following text into the file, and save it:

    ```<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
        <h1>404</h1>
        </body>
        </html>
    ```

17. Click on the Azure logo where you will be asked to log in. Once you have authenticated to Azure with the extension, expand the **Storage accounts**, then expand the storage account you have created, then expand **Blob containers**, then right-click on the **$web** storage container. You’ll see an option to **Deploy to Static Website via Azure storage**. Select that option.

![image](../media/str23.png)

18. Choose the folder containing the two files mentioned earlier. 

![image](../media/str24.png)

19. Visual Studio Code will then deploy those files as your static page and return a success message to you. Please select  **Browse to website button** Once the files have been uploaded, navigate to the primary endpoint you received earlier.

### Task 5: Apply the lifecycle Management Policy

In this task, you will learn how to use the Azure portal to Apply the lifecycle management policy of a storage account. Azure Storage lifecycle management offers a rule-based policy that you can use to transition blob data to the appropriate access tiers or to expire data at the end of the data lifecycle. A lifecycle policy acts on a base blob, and optionally on the blob's versions or snapshots. For example, if you have defined an action to move a blob from the hot tier to the cool tier if it has not been modified for 30 days, then the lifecycle management policy will move the blob 30 days after the last write operation to that blob.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

An Azure account, a storage account (Complete Task 1), an azure blob container (Complete Task 1 & Task 2). Before doing the steps to configure Lifecycle management policy, please go to the storage account created on the previous task and select configuration under settings to view the configuration of your storage account, which you are going to apply Lifecycle management policy.

![image](../media/life1.png)

#### Steps

1. Go to **Lifecycle management** under **Data management** of the storage account created on the previous task. Please select **Add rule**.

![image](../media/life2.png)

2. On the **Add a rule** page please enter the **rule name** as **Testrule** and keep the default settings as it is and select **Next**

![image](../media/life3a.png)

3. On the Add a rule page, under the **Base blob** tab, enter the following settings as per the image below: and please select **add** button.

![image](../media/life4.png)

4. You have now created your lifecycle management policy for storage blobs, after 30 days, your storage blobs will be moved to the cool access tier.

![image](../media/life5.png)

If you are not seeing newly created lifecycle management policy please select the lifecycle management and select refresh.
