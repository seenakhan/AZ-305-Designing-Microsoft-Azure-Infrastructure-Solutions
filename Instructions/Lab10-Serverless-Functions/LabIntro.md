# Lab 10 - Serverless Functions

# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You want to deploy a serverless solution which lets you write less code, manage less infrastructure, and save money. Instead of having to worry about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all of the current resources required to keep your applications running. So to implement this, you have been tasked with the following functionality:

- Create a Storage account and create a function app. Azure Functions allows you to implement your system's logic into readily available blocks of code. These code blocks are called "functions". Different functions can run anytime you need to respond to critical events. You will create a storage account and and Azure function app.

- Configure a local Azure Functions project. You will create a local azure functions project by using Visual studio code.

- Create function that canbe triggered by HTTP request. You will create an HTTP triggered function and test the function. The HTTP trigger allows you to call a function using an HTTP request. You can create serverless APIs by using an HTTP trigger.

- Create a function that triggers on a schedule. You will create an HTTP triggered function and test it on 5 seconds and 30 seconds schedule.

- Create a function that integrates with other services and Deploy Local project to an Azure function app. You will create a function app whihc can be integrated with other services and then deploy it in the Azure function app. After that you will verify the deployed app.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will have:

+ Exercise 1: Create Azure resources.
+ Exercise 2: Configure a local Azure Functions project.
+ Exercise 3: Create a function that's triggered by an HTTP request.
+ Exercise 4: Create a function that triggers on a schedule.
+ Exercise 5: Create a function that integrates with other services and Deploy Local project to an Azure function app.
