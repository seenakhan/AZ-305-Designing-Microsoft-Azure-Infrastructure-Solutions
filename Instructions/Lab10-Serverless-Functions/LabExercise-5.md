#### Task 2: Create an HTTP-triggered function

In this task, you will create an HTTP triggered function.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1 & Exercise 2 & Exercise 3 & Exercise 4 & Exercise 5 - Task 1 & Task 2

#### Steps:

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**, open new terminal, if the current directory is not **C:\AllFiles\func**
1. Run the following command to change the current directory to the **C:\AllFiles\func** directory:

    ```powershell
    cd C:\AllFiles\func
    ```

1. From the command prompt, run the following command to use the **Azure Functions Core Tools** to create a new function named **GetSettingInfo**, using the **HTTP trigger** template:

#### Task 3: Write HTTP-triggered and blob-inputted function code

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1 & Exercise 2 & Exercise 3 & Exercise 4 & Exercise 5 - Task 1 & Task 2 & Task 3

#### Steps:

1. On the **Explorer** pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, open the **GetSettingInfo.cs** file.
1. In the code editor, observe the example implementation:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    using Newtonsoft.Json;    
    namespace func
    {
        public static class GetSettingInfo
        {
            [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]
            public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
                [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
                ILogger log)
            {
                log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");    
                string name = req.Query["name"];    
                string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
                dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
                name = name ?? data?.name;    
                string responseMessage = string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)
                    ? "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response."
                    : $"Hello, {name}. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.";    
                return new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Delete all the content within the **GetSettingInfo.cs** file.

1. Add the following lines of code to add **using directives** for the **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http**, **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc**, and **Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs** namespaces:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    ```

1. Create a new **public static** class named **GetSettingInfo**:

    ```csharp
    public static class GetSettingInfo
    { }
    ```

1. Observe the **GetSettingInfo.cs** file again, which should now include the following code:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    public static class GetSettingInfo
    { }
    ```

1. Within the **GetSettingInfo** class, add the following code block to create a new **public static** expression-bodied method named **Run** that returns a variable of type **IActionResult** and that also takes in variables of type **HttpRequest** and **string** as parameters named *request* and *json*:

    ```csharp
    public static IActionResult Run(
        HttpRequest request,
        string json)
        => null;
    ```

    > **Note**: You are only temporarily setting the return value to **null**.

1. Add the following code to append an attribute to the **Run** method of type **FunctionNameAttribute** that has its **name** parameter set to a value of **GetSettingInfo**:

    ```csharp
    [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]
    public static IActionResult Run(
        HttpRequest request,
        string json)
        => null;
    ```

1. Add the following code to append an attribute to the **request** parameter of type **HttpTriggerAttribute** that has its **methods** parameter array set to a single value of **GET**:

    ```csharp
    [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]
    public static IActionResult Run(
        [HttpTrigger("GET")] HttpRequest request,
        string json)
        => null;
    ```

1. Add the following code to append an attribute to the **json** parameter of type **BlobAttribute** that has its **blobPath** parameter set to a value of **content/settings.json**:

    ```csharp
    [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]
    public static IActionResult Run(
        [HttpTrigger("GET")] HttpRequest request,
        [Blob("content/settings.json")] string json)
        => null;
    ```

1. Add the following code to update the **Run** expression-bodied method to return a new instance of the **OkObjectResult** class passing in the value of the **json** method parameter as the sole constructor parameter:

    ```csharp
    [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]
    public static IActionResult Run(
        [HttpTrigger("GET")] HttpRequest request,
        [Blob("content/settings.json")] string json)
        => new OkObjectResult(json);
    ```

1. Observe the **GetSettingInfo.cs** file again, which should now include the following code:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    public static class GetSettingInfo
    {
        [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]
        public static IActionResult Run(
            [HttpTrigger("GET")] HttpRequest request,
            [Blob("content/settings.json")] string json)
            => new OkObjectResult(json);
    }
    ```

1. Select **Save** to save your changes to the **GetSettingInfo.cs** file.

### Task 4: Register Azure Storage Blob extensions

### Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges, although keep in mind that Azure policies do not incur extra cost.
   
   >**Note**:  Don't worry if the lab resources cannot be immediately removed. Sometimes resources have dependencies and take a longer time to delete. It is a common Administrator task to monitor resource usage, so just periodically review your resources in the Portal to see how the cleanup is going.

   
1. Select the funaction app you have created, then select **Stop** from the top on the overview section. Then click on **Delete**. Enter the name of the function app to confirm the deletion and then click **Delete**.
2. Select Home and then storage account.

2. Select the Storage account named **contosofuncstor** then select **Delete**.

#### Review

In this lab, you have:

- Created a Local project
- Deployed local project into Azure function app.
- Validated the project.
