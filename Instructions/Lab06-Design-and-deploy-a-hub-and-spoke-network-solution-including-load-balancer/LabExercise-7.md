## Exercise 7: Create a Load Balancer and Test the Load balancer

In this exercise, you will use Azure Virtual Networks created on the previous exercise to deploy a load balancer and test it.

In this Exercise, you will have:

  + Task 1: Create load balancer.
  + Task 2: Create NAT gateway.
  + Task 3: Create virtual machines.
  + Task 4: Install IIS.
  + Task 5: Test the load balancer.

### Estimated Timing: 70 minutes

### Task 1: Create load balancer.

In this task, you'll create a zone redundant load balancer that load balances virtual machines. With zone-redundancy, one or more availability zones can fail and the data path survives as long as one zone in the region remains healthy.

During the creation of the load balancer, you'll configure:

+ Frontend IP address
+ Backend pool
+ Inbound load-balancing rules
+ Health probe

#### Pre-requisites for this task

#### Steps:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Load balancer**. Select **Load balancers** in the search results.

2. In the **Load balancers** page, select **+ Create**.

5. Once contosoVM1 opens in the browser, please open the **Powershell** and enter the following scripts:

    In the PowerShell Window, run the following commands to:

    + Install the IIS server
    + Remove the default iisstart.htm file
    + Add a new iisstart.htm file that displays the name of the VM:

    ```powershell
    # Install IIS server role
    Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools

    # Remove default htm file
    Remove-Item  C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm

    # Add a new htm file that displays server name
    Add-Content -Path "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm" -Value $("Hello World from " + $env:computername)
    ```

    ![img](../media/nat11.png)

6. Close the Bastion session with contosoVM1.

    ![img](../media/nat14.png)

You have successfully tested the Load balancer.

### Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges, although keep in mind that Azure policies do not incur extra cost. Don't worry if the lab resources cannot be immediately removed. Sometimes resources have dependencies and take a longer time to delete. It is a common Administrator task to monitor resource usage, so just periodically review your resources in the Portal to see how the cleanup is going.

   >**When you're done, delete the resource group. Deleting the resource group deletes the storage account, the Azure file share, virtual machine and any other resources that you deployed inside the resource group.**

1. Select Home and then Resource groups.

2. Select the resource group you want to delete.

3. If the lock is restricted to delete the resource group, please go to the Locks under settings tab of the resource group and select delete.

3. Select Delete resource group. A window opens and displays a warning about the resources that will be deleted with the resource group.

4. Enter the name of the resource group, and then select Delete.
    
#### Review

In this lab, you have:

- Deployed a Load balancer.
- Configured a Nat gateway.
- Created two virtual machines.
- Install IIS on the newly created virtual machine.
- Tested the Load balancer.
