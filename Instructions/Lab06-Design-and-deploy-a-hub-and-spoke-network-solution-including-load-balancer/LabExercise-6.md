## Exercise 6: Verify deployment of configurations

In this exercise, You are going to verify the hub and spoke virtual network connectivity from a virtual network and a virtual machine.

In this Exercise, you will have:

  + Task 1: Verify from a Virtual network.
  + Task 2: Verify from a Virtual machine.

### Estimated Timing: 45 minutes

### Task 1: Verify from a Virtual network

In this task, you are going to verify the hub and spoke virtual network connectivity from a virtual network.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

9. Please select **Effective Routes** under **Help** to see the routes for the virtual network peerings. The 10.1.0.0/16 route with the next hop of VNetGlobalPeering is the route to the hub virtual network. The 10.3.0.0/16 route with the next hop of ConnectedGroup is route to the other spoke virtual network. All spokes virtual network will be in a ConnectedGroup when Transitivity is enabled.
