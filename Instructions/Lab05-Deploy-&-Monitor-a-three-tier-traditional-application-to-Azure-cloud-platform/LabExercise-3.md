## Exercise 3: Monitor and assess the solutions and data in the Azure cloud platform

Azure Monitor collects and aggregates the data from every layer and component of your system into a common data platform. In this exercise you are going to monitor azure resources deployed on previous exercises. 

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Register the Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers
+ Task 2: Create and configure an Azure Automation-based solutions
+ Task 3: Review default monitoring settings of Azure Resources
+ Task 4: Collect and View Azure resource logs.
### Estimated Timing: 60 minutes

### Task 1: Register the Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers

In this task, you will register two resource providers named Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1 & Exercise 2

#### Steps:

1. Go to the Azure portal, select **Cloud shell** and on the cloud shell pane please select **Powershell** and then select  **Create storage**.

2. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to register the **Microsoft.Insights** and **Microsoft.AlertsManagement** resource providers.

   ```powershell
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Insights

   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AlertsManagement
   ```

You have successfully registered Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers

### Task 2: Create and configure an Azure Automation-based solutions

In this task, you will create and configure an Azure Automation-based solutions

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1 & Exercise 2 & Exercise 3 - Task 1

#### Steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Automation Accounts**, and on the **Automation Accounts** blade, click **+ Create**.

   ![img](../media/mon4.png)

2. On the **Create an Automation Account** blade, specify the following settings, and click **Review + Create**. Once the validation check is passed, click **Create**:

    | Settings | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | The name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **newres123** |
    | Automation account name | **contosoautomation1** |
    | Region | The name of the Azure region determined based on [Workspace mappings documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/how-to/region-mappings) |

   ![img](../media/mon5a.png)

   
    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment might take about 3 minutes.

5. Click **Go to resource**.

6. On the Automation account blade, in the **Configuration Management** section, click **Inventory**.

7. In the **Inventory** pane, in the **Log Analytics workspace** drop-down list, select **Create New Workspace** and select **Enable**.

   ![img](../media/mon6.png)
   
   >**Note**: Wait for the installation of the corresponding Log Analytics solution to complete. This might take about 3 minutes.

    >**Note**: This automatically installs the **Change tracking** solution as well.

8. On the **Automation Account** blade, under **Update Management** section, click **Update management** and click **Enable**.

   ![img](../media/mon7.png)

    >**Note**: Wait for the installation to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.

After this you are going to review the default monitoring settings of azure resources.

### Task 3: Review default monitoring settings of Azure Resources

In this task, you will review default monitoring settings of Azure virtual machine.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1 & Exercise 2 & Exercise 3 - Task 1 & Task 2

#### Steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Virtual Machines** and select Virtual machines from the list. On the **Virtual machines** page, select **labvm-XXXXX**.

2. On the **labvm-XXXXX** page, in the **Monitoring** section, click **Metrics**.

3. On the **labvm-XXXXX| Metrics** page, on the default chart, note that the only available **Metrics Namespace** is **Virtual Machine Host**.

   ![img](../media/mon8.png) 

>**Note**: This is expected, since no guest-level diagnostic settings have been configured yet. You do have, however, the option of enabling guest memory metrics directly from the **Metrics Namespace** drop down-list. You will enable it later in this exercise.

4. In the **Metric** drop-down list, review the list of available metrics.

    >**Note**: The list includes a range of CPU, disk, and network-related metrics that can be collected from the virtual machine host, without having access into guest-level metrics.

5. In the **Metric** drop-down list, select **Percentage CPU**, in the **Aggregation** drop-down list, select **Avg**, and review the resulting chart.

   ![img](../media/mon9.png)

6. Go to **App services**, select **web-app-XXXXX-XXXXXX** app service, select **Metrics** under **Monitoring**. 

7. In the **Metric** drop-down list, select **CPU Time**, in the **Aggregation** drop-down list, select **Sum**, and review the resulting chart.

### Task 4: Collect and View Azure resource logs

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1 & Exercise 2 & Exercise 3 - Task 1 & Task 2 & Task 3

#### Steps:

In this task, you will configure Azure virtual machine diagnostic settings.

1. On the **labvm-XXXXX** page, in the **Monitoring** section, select **Diagnostic settings**.

2. On the **Overview** tab of the **labvm-XXXXX | Diagnostic settings** page, select a **Diagnostic storage account**, and then click **Enable guest-level monitoring**.

   ![img](../media/mon13.png)

    >**Note**: Wait for the diagnostic settings extension to be installed. This might take about 3 minutes.

3. Switch to the **Performance counters** tab of the **labvm-XXXXX | Diagnostic settings** page and review the available counters.

   ![img](../media/mon14.png)

    >**Note**: By default, CPU, memory, disk, and network counters are enabled. You can switch to the **Custom** view for more detailed listing.

4. On the **labvm-XXXXX** page, in the **Monitoring** section, click **Logs** and then click **Enable**.

   ![img](../media/mon15.png)

5. On the **Monitoring configuration** side screen, ensure **Azure Monitor agent (Recommended)** is selected, and then click **Configure**.  

   ![img](../media/mon16.png)

    >**Note**: Do not wait for the operation to be completed, but instead proceed to the next step. The operation might take about 5 minutes.

6. On the **labvm-XXXXX | Logs** page, in the **Monitoring** section, click **Metrics**.

7. On the **labvm-XXXXX | Metrics** page, on the default chart, note that at this point, the **Metrics Namespace** drop-down list, in addition to the **Virtual Machine Host** entry includes also the **Guest (classic)** entry.

   ![img](../media/mon17.png)

    >**Note**: This is expected, since you enabled guest-level diagnostic settings. You also have the option to **Enable new guest memory metrics**.

8. In the **Metrics Namespace** drop-down list, select  the **Guest (classic)** entry.

9. In the **Metric** drop-down list, review the list of available metrics.

    >**Note**: The list includes additional guest-level metrics not available when relying on the host-level monitoring only.

10. In the **Metric** drop-down list, select **Memory\\Available Bytes**, in the **Aggregation** drop-down list, select **Max**, and review the resulting chart.

#### Clean up resources

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges. Don't worry if the lab resources cannot be immediately removed. Sometimes resources have dependencies and take a longer time to delete. It is a common Administrator task to monitor resource usage, so just periodically review your resources in the Portal to see how the cleanup is going. 

In the Azure portal, go to Resource groups, select **newres123**, then select **Delete**.

#### Review

In this lab, you have:

+ Registered the Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers
+ Created and configured an Azure Automation-based solutions
+ Reviewed default monitoring settings of Azure resources
+ Collected and Viewed Azure resource logs
