## Exercise 2: Review High Availability Capabilities (Test Failover)

In this exercise, you are going to review the test failover for two app services deployed on different regions.

In this exercise, you will have:

+ Task 1: Add Traffic Manager endpoints.
+ Task 2: Test Traffic Manager profile

### Estimated Timing : 45 minutes

### Task 1: Add Traffic Manager endpoints

In this task, you are going to add the website in the **East US** as primary endpoint to route all the user traffic. Add the website in **West US** as a failover endpoint. When the primary endpoint is unavailable, traffic automatically routes to the failover endpoint.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1

#### Steps:

1. In **Load balancing | Traffic Manager** page, please select **contosotrafficmanager-1**, in the **Settings** section, select **Endpoints**, and then select **+ Add**.

2. On the **Add Endpoint** side screen, please enter the following informations and then select **Add**.

    | Section | Values |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | Type | Select **Azure endpoint**  |
    | Name | Enter **contosoPrimaryEndpoint** |
    | Target resource type | Select **App Service** |
    | Target resource | Select **web-app-XXXXX-XXXX (West US)** |
    | Priority | Select **1** |

3. To create a failover endpoint for your second Azure region, repeat steps 1 and 2 with these settings:

    | Section | Values |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | Type | Select **Azure endpoint**  |
    | Name | Enter **contosoFailoverEndpoint** |
    | Target resource type | Select **App Service** |
    | Target resource | Select **web-app-EastUS (East US)** |
    | Priority | Select **2** |

You have successfully added both the endpoints.

### Task 2: Test Traffic Manager profile

In this task, you will do a test failover to test the traffic manager profile.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

Completed Exercise 1 & Exercise 2 - Task 1

#### Steps: 

1. Go to the **Overview** section of the **Traffic Manager profile** that you created in the preceding Exercise.

2. Copy the **DNS** name of the **contosotrafficmanager-1**.

3. Open a new tab of your browser and enter the DNS name of your Traffic Manager profile to view your Web App's default website.

    ![img](../media/trafp8.png)

You can see the Web app running successfully .

To view Traffic Manager failover in action, disable your primary site:

4. In the Traffic Manager Profile page, from the **Overview** section, select **contosoPrimaryEndpoint**.

5. In **contosoPrimaryEndpoint**, select **Disabled** and then select **Save**.

    ![img](../media/trafp9.png)

6. Close **contosoPrimaryEndpoint**. Notice that the status is Disabled now.

7. Copy the DNS name of your Traffic Manager Profile from the preceding step to view the website in a new web browser session.

Verify that the web app is still available.

The primary endpoint isn't available, so you were routed to the failover endpoint.
