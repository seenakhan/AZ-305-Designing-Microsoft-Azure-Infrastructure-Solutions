# Instructions

## Exercise 3: Configure Front door profile and deploy App services in Azure.

In this exercise, you will create two Web App instances that are deployed in two different Azure regions. Both web application instances will run in Active/Active mode, so either one can service incoming traffic. This configuration differs from an Active/Stand-By configuration, where one acts as a failover.

In this Exercise, you will have:

  + Task 1: Create two instances of a web app.
  + Task 2: Create a Front Door Profile.
  + Task 3: View Azure Front Door in action

### Estimated Timing: 60 minutes
