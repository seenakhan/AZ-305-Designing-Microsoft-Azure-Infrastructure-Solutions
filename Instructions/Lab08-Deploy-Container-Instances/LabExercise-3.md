## Exercise 3: Configure Front door profile and deploy App services in Azure.

In this exercise, you will create two Web App instances that are deployed in two different Azure regions. Both web application instances will run in Active/Active mode, so either one can service incoming traffic. This configuration differs from an Active/Stand-By configuration, where one acts as a failover.

In this Exercise, you will have:

  + Task 1: Create two instances of a web app.
  + Task 2: Create a Front Door Profile.
  + Task 3: View Azure Front Door in action

### Estimated Timing: 60 minutes

### Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges, although keep in mind that Azure policies do not incur extra cost.
   
   >**Note**:  Don't worry if the lab resources cannot be immediately removed. Sometimes resources have dependencies and take a longer time to delete. It is a common Administrator task to monitor resource usage, so just periodically review your resources in the Portal to see how the cleanup is going.


1. Select the resource group named **ODL-AZ-305M05C-XXXXX**

2. Select the contosowebapps, contosoappserviceplan, contosofrontdoor then select delete from the top.
