#### Pre-requisites for this task

Complete Exercise 1.

#### Steps:

5. Open an **InPrivate** browser window and sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the newly created user account. When prompted to update the password, change the password to a secure password of your choosing. 

    >**Note**: Rather than typing the username (including the domain name), you can paste the content of Clipboard.

6. In the **InPrivate** browser window, in the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.

    >**Note**: While this user account can access the Azure Active Directory tenant, it does not have any access to Azure resources. This is expected since such access would need to be granted explicitly by using Azure Role-Based Access Control. 

7. In the **InPrivate** browser window, on the Azure AD blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Users**, and then click **+ New user**.

    | Setting | Value |

    | Username  | **az305-01a-aaduser2** |
    | Name | **az305-01a-aaduser2** |
    | Let me create the password | enabled |
    | Initial password | **Provide a secure password** |
    | Usage location | **United States** |
    | Job title | **System Administrator** |
    | Department | **IT** |

9. You have successfully created the new user.

### Task 3: Add Custom RBAC roles

Create a custom role in Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) if none of the built-in roles meet your specific access needs. Custom roles can be created using Azure PowerShell, Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI), and the REST API. Just like built-in roles, custom roles can be assigned to users, groups, and applications at subscription, resource group, and resource scopes.

1. Go to the **ODL-AZ-305-M02B-XXXXXXX** resource group.

2. On the resource group page, please select **Access control (IAM)**, then select **+Add**, then select **Add custom role**.
