## Exercise 1: Create Management Groups and assign Subscriptions

In this exercise you will create three management groups and assign subscriptions to each management groups via Azure portal.

In this Exercise, you will have:

+ Task 1: Create Management Groups.
+ Task 2: Create Child Management Groups.
+ Task 3: Assign subscriptions to management groups

### Task 1: Create Management Groups

In this task, you will create a Management Group via the Azure portal.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

An Azure account. Any Azure AD user in the tenant can create a management group without the management group write permission assigned to that user if hierarchy protection isn't enabled. This new management group becomes a child of the Root Management Group or the default management group and the creator is given an "Owner" role assignment. Management group service allows this ability so that role assignments aren't needed at the root level. No users have access to the Root Management Group when it's created. To avoid the hurdle of finding the Azure AD Global Admins to start using management groups, we allow the creation of the initial management groups at the root level.

#### Steps:

1. Log into the Azure portal.

2. Select **All Services** and select **Azure Active Directory**.

>**Now you can create child management groups and assign subscriptions to each group**.

>**Note: The Management Group ID is the directory unique identifier that is used to submit commands on this management group. This identifier isn't editable after creation as it's used throughout the Azure system to identify this group. The root management group is automatically created with an ID that is the Azure Active Directory ID. For all other management groups, assign a unique ID.**

>**The display name field is the name that is displayed within the Azure portal. A separate display name is an optional field when creating the management group and can be changed at any time.**
