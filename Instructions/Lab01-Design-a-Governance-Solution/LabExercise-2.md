9. You have successfully created the storage account now.

      **Note : If you want to check with the excluded resource group from policy assignment, you can create another storage account by using the same steps, but by selecting the excluded resource group.**    

### Task 3: Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges, although keep in mind that Azure policies do not incur extra cost.
   
   >**Note**:  Don't worry if the lab resources cannot be immediately removed. Sometimes resources have dependencies and take a longer time to delete. It is a common Administrator task to monitor resource usage, so just periodically review your resources in the Portal to see how the cleanup is going. 

1. In the portal, search for and select **Policy**.

1. In the **Authoring** section, click **Assignments**, click the ellipsis icon to the right of the assignment you created in the previous task and click **Delete assignment**. 

1. In the portal, search for and select **Storage accounts**.

1. In the list of storage accounts, select the resource group corresponding to the storage account you created in the last task of this lab. Select **Tags** and click **Delete** (Trash can to the right) to the **Role:Owner** tag and press **Apply**. 

1. Click **Overview** and click **Delete** on the top of the storage account blade. When prompted for the confirmation, in the **Delete storage account** blade, type the name of the storage account to confirm and click **Delete**.
